##### Synopsis
 Future home of the world's largest repo of Python exploits and tools. I didn't really find anything great in existence, so making it myself. My table of contents will likely be garbage, so you should probably rely on Ctrl + F.
 
 Really I just want to make something people will use so if you have input, DM me on Twitter: [@MythicStack](https://www.twitter.com/MythicStack). 
 
 If you think a project should be included here I really want to know, but keep in mind that this isn't supposed to be a dictionary. I want to keep the best, covering as many bases as possible while minimizing overlap.

##### Information Gathering

- [Anubis](https://github.com/jonluca/Anubis) - Subdomain enumerator actively maintained by [jonluca](https://github.com/jonluca). It's a good tool and it works well. Has the added benefit of having a nice README with clear examples. Every issue (at the time of writing) has been resolved. The dude has some pretty cool projects on his blog too.
- [DaProfiler](https://github.com/daprofiler/DaProfiler) - This a person profiler and covers bases that others on this list do not. It's fairly in-depth, updated regularly, and has a clean UI. Easy to use and works well, some false positives.
- [holehe](https://github.com/megadose/holehe) - Simple mail checker for popular websites. Clean and to the point, updated by [megadose](https://twitter.com/palenath) as needed. They also have a lot of other interesting projects.
- [IntelOwl](https://github.com/intelowlproject/IntelOwl) - It's a cool malware/malspam threat intel tool. It's mostly Python, but it's pretty JS heavy. I've used it and my thoughts on it are: "Clean/Functional/Well Documented, but it smells like a corporate project."
- [Metagoofil](https://github.com/laramies/metagoofil) - This is an oldie, but a goodie from the days of Python 2. This tool helps obtain files and metadata from target websites using Google.
- [Moriarty Project](https://github.com/AzizKpln/Moriarty-Project) - Checks for provided phone number on popular websites, performs searches, and provides ownership information.
- [Osintgram](https://github.com/Datalux/Osintgram) - Instagram is a wealth of data for those that look, it's maintained by a lot of folks, but Instagram changes may break functionality. It's a well organized project and lots of forks to take a look at.
- [Recon-ng](https://github.com/lanmaster53/recon-ng) - The OSINT equivalent to the Metasploit Framework. Could be updated more often, but it's well respected and there's decades of content on the internet to help you get familiar with it. 
- [sherlock](https://github.com/sherlock-project/sherlock) - Best broad social media hunter I've used by far. So simple a caveman could do it. 
- [SpiderFoot](https://github.com/smicallef/spiderfoot) - Easily the coolest OSINT tool on the list, it would be first if I wasn't trying to keep this thing alphabetical. Its perks are too numerous to outline here, go to their page.
- [theHarvester](https://github.com/laramies/theHarvester) - Jack of Most Trades OSINT tool maintained by a bunch of people. Often Updated and might as well be a household name. It's well-rounded and efficient. What more could you ask for?
